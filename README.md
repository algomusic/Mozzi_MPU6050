# Mozzi_MPU6050
Example code for reading an MPU6050 accelerometer on an Arduino-class processor using I2C communication but without using the Wire library that blocks audio synthesis when using the Mozzi audio library.

This code is based on Roger Cheng's Mozzi_MMA7660 respository, which in turn is based on the twi-nonblock library and sample code for the ADXL345 by Marije Baalman, included in the Mozzi library. With thanks for clues from the MPU6050_light library by Romain Feitck.
